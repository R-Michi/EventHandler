* @title:        Event handler
* @author:       Michael Reim
* @date:         21.02.2021
* @description:
*   This library includes a general purpose event handler.
*   As events get handled asynchronously, synchronization must be made BY THE USER.
*   
*   If there are any bugs in this library please report it to the following link:
*   https://github.com/R-Michi/EventHandler/issues
*   Note that the creator of the library does not guarantee full functionality at improper use.
*   How to use the event handler the intended way, have a look at the documentation.
*
* @version release 1.3.1
